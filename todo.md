# Todolist

- Implement path finding from previous game (brutna on my github)
- Make different barriers to place
  - make the enamies break the barriers if the path finder says that they should.
    - give barriers hp
- add turrets
  - make aggro affect path finding( make enemies want to attack turrets )

- Make enemies bite you and attach to you
  - keep the ability for them to get scraped of by rounding a corner
  - add other ways to get rid of them
  - add other mechanics, perhaps things to walk through to get rid of the enemies. perhaps make them slow you down
